Executive Summary
StreamVC proposes to launch its project token on ZCombinator with 23% of total supply allocated to $ZC stakers through a believer-score weighted presale mechanism, paired exclusively with $ZC tokens to create a symbiotic liquidity ecosystem. This proposal seeks market approval through a prediction market where the community can "trade vote" on whether StreamVC meets the quality threshold for launch on the ZCombinator platform.

Current Situation
•⁠ ⁠Opportunity: StreamVC seeks to leverage ZCombinator's believer-score infrastructure to ensure aligned, long-term token holders
•⁠ ⁠Value Proposition: StreamVC will allocate 23% of $STREAM tokens exclusively to $ZC stakers for presale, creating direct value accrual for the ZCombinator community
•⁠ ⁠Market Validation Need: Community must signal confidence in StreamVC's fundamentals before presale opens

Proposed Solution
Launch a prediction market (trade-vote mechanism) where:
•⁠ ⁠$ZC holders can buy PASS/FAIL shares on "Should StreamVC launch on ZCombinator?"
•⁠ ⁠Market prices reflect real-time community sentiment and due diligence
•⁠ ⁠If proposal passes, StreamVC executes presale with the following mechanics:
○ 23% of total $STREAM supply (230,000,000 tokens) allocated to presale
○ All presale funds collected in $ZC tokens and used to seed AMM LP
○ $STREAM launches paired exclusively with $ZC on AMM
Example Mechanics (Assuming 20M ZC deposited in presale)

Proposed Launch Structure:
•⁠ ⁠230,000,000 STREAM sold to $ZC stakers for 20,000,000 ZC
•⁠ ⁠70,000,000 STREAM (7% of supply) paired with presale proceeds on AMM
•⁠ ⁠With ZC at $0.953M market cap and 20M ZC raised ($13.6k), $STREAM opens at $0.2M fully diluted valuation
•⁠ ⁠7% liquidity at launch ($13.6k liquidity)
•⁠ ⁠Results in 3-4x markup potential for presale participants at sustainable liquidity levels
•⁠ ⁠$ZC gains permanent liquidity pairing with new project
•
Benefits to ZCombinator Ecosystem:
•⁠ ⁠For $ZC Stakers: Exclusive presale access + believer-score weighted allocations prevent whale dominance
•⁠ ⁠For $ZC Token: New liquidity pair creates utility and trading volume for $ZC
•⁠ ⁠For ZCombinator Platform: Demonstrates quality curation and aligned token launches
•⁠ ⁠For StreamVC: Access to high-conviction holders via ZC aligned stakers, reducing post-launch dump risk

The proposal passes if the decision market pass-fail gap > 1% calculated using TWAP over the final 24 hours of the trading period.
